 * CI gate: no machine-local paths in tracked files. Family invariant, mirrored byte-for-byte across
 * the three Reactive UI Toolkit repos except for the DATA blocks below (the corpus-hash.mjs
 * precedent: same script, per-leg data).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: the rebrand wave rewrote a repo-folder segment INSIDE a hardcoded absolute path
 * (`…/ReactiveUI-Unreal/…` -> `…/ruitk-unreal/…` in .vscode/launch.json), which silently broke F5
 * for every clone whose folder name differs from the author's. Three independent audits looked at
 * that line, classified it "owner machine path — leave it", and stopped one level too shallow.
 * Judgment missed it three times; a grep cannot. Hence a gate rather than a note.
 *
 * THE INVARIANT: machine facts live in an env var or the gitignored .ruitk-local.json (see the
 * "Machine-local paths" section of CLAUDE.md) — never in a tracked file. Repo locations are DERIVED,
 * never written down: the repo root is this script's `..`, worktrees come from `git worktree list`.
 *
 * Specimen paths in this file are written `<drive>:` rather than with a real drive letter ON PURPOSE:
 * this script is scanned by itself, and a gate whose rules do not apply to the file defining the
 * rules is a permanent blind spot. Do not "fix" them into literal paths.
 *
 * TWO RULES
 *   R1 PERSONAL-ROOT PATHS — a drive-absolute path (`<drive>:\…`, `<drive>:/…`) or an explicit
 *      user-home POSIX path (`/home/<u>/`, `/Users/<u>/`, `/mnt/<d>/`) whose root is NOT in ALLOWED_ROOTS.
 *      Standard shared roots are deliberately legitimate: tool-discovery code SHOULD name
 *      `C:\Program Files\…` when probing for an engine/SDK, and CI workflows SHOULD name their
 *      runner's paths. What is never legitimate is a path that exists only on one person's disk.
 *   R2 PORTABILITY-CRITICAL FILES — the files in PORTABILITY_CRITICAL must contain ZERO
 *      drive-absolute paths regardless of root. They execute on other people's machines and have
 *      variable substitution available (`${workspaceFolder}`, `$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)`), so an
 *      absolute path there is never the right answer even when it points somewhere standard.
 *
 * EXEMPTIONS are data, not code, and each one carries a `why`. Two classes earn one:
 *   - frozen tiers (archived plans, research, shipped changelog history) — the historical record is
 *     not ours to edit;
 *   - test trees — synthetic fixtures like "<drive>:/proj/Assets/UI" exist precisely to assert
 *     Windows-path handling; they are the thing under test, not a leak.
 * A single line can also opt out with a trailing `path-gate-allow: <reason>` comment — for the rare
 * doc-comment that must show a literal Windows path to explain URI logic. The reason lives next to
 * the code, which beats a growing central list nobody re-reads.
 *
 *   node scripts/check-machine-paths.mjs           check (CI gate; exit 1 on violation)
 *   node scripts/check-machine-paths.mjs --list    print every absolute path found, with verdict
